Using a user-defined function to create plots quickens the analysis of customer trends and mimics the approach taken by business intelligence software that allow for slicing by a specific feature.
The code below creates a scatter plot graph showing the relationship between bike rentals and temperature over the 24 months between Jan 2011 and Dec. 2012.

```{r Function}
data <-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OunzaC/animatedggplot/main/bikes.csv")
data$date<-as.Date(data$date)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
library(av)
bikerentals_fun <-function(day) {
  bikesdata <- data %>%
    filter(weekday == day) %>%
    mutate(year = format(date,format = "%Y - %m"))
a<-ggplot(bikesdata, aes(windspeed, rentals)) + geom_point()+
labs(title = 'Correlation of Windspeed and Rentals', 
       x = 'Windspeed', 
       y = 'Bike rentals') +
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  transition_time(date)+
  ease_aes('linear')
animation <- a + exit_shrink()
anim_save("animation.mp4", animation = animation,renderer = av_renderer())
return(animation)
}

bikerentals_fun(1)
```
